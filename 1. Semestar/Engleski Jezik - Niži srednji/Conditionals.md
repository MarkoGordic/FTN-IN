## Zero Conditional

Zero conditional sentences express **general truths**â€”situations in which one thing **always** causes another.

```
IF   - present simple
MAIN - present simple
```

### Examples:

- If you donâ€™t brush your teeth, you get cavities.

- When people smoke cigarettes, their health suffers.

There are a couple of things to take note of in the above sentences using the zero conditional. First, when using the zero conditional, the correct tense in both clauses is the simple present tense. **A common mistake is to use the simple future tense.**

## First Conditional

First conditional sentences are used to express situations in which the outcome is **likely (but not guaranteed) to happen** in the future.

```
IF   - present simple
MAIN - simple future
```

### Examples:

- If you rest, you will feel better.

- If you set your mind to a goal, youâ€™ll eventually achieve it.

This is how we indicate that under a certain condition (as expressed in the if-clause), a specific result will likely happen in the future.

## Second Conditionals

Second conditional sentences are useful for expressing outcomes that are **completely unrealistic** or **will not likely happen** in the future.

```
IF   - simple past
MAIN - modal auxiliary verb (e.g., would, should, could, might)
```

### Examples:

- If I inherited a billion dollars, I would travel to the moon.

- If I owned a zoo, I might let people interact with the animals more.

Use a modal auxiliary verb in the main clause when using the second conditional to express the unlikelihood that the result will actually happen.

## Third Conditional

Third conditional sentences are used to explain that **present circumstances would be differen**t if something different **had happened in the past**.

```
IF   - had + past participle
MAIN - modal auxiliary (would, could, should, etc.) + have + past participle
```

### Examples:

- If you had told me you needed a ride, I would have left earlier.

- If I had cleaned the house, I could have gone to the movies.

With third conditional sentences, do not use a modal auxiliary verb in the if-clause. The third conditional expresses a situation that could have happened in the past only if a certain condition had been met. Thatâ€™s why we use the modal auxiliary verb + have + the past participle.
